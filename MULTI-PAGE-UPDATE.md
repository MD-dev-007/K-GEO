## Design Consistency

Both pages maintain:

- ✅ Same typography (Inter font family)
- ✅ Same component styling (rounded corners, shadows, gradients)
- ✅ Same navigation and footer
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile-first)
- ✅ Smooth transitions and hover effects

## How to Use

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install React Router along with all other dependencies.

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to:
- `http://localhost:3000/` for Home page
- `http://localhost:3000/about` for About page

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

The router will work correctly in production builds.

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Add More Pages
Create new page components in `src/components/pages/`:
- `PartnershipsPage.tsx`
- `GlobalFacultyPage.tsx`
- `ResearchPage.tsx`

Then add routes in `src/App.tsx`:
```typescript
<Route path="/partnerships" element={<PartnershipsPage />} />
<Route path="/global-faculty" element={<GlobalFacultyPage />} />
<Route path="/research" element={<ResearchPage />} />
```

Update navigation links in `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`.

### Add 404 Page
```typescript
<Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
```

### Add Scroll to Top
Install `react-router-dom` scroll restoration:
```typescript
import { ScrollRestoration } from 'react-router-dom';

// In App.tsx
<ScrollRestoration />
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Home page loads at `/`
- [x] About page loads at `/about`
- [x] Navigation links work correctly
- [x] Footer appears on all pages
- [x] Mobile responsive design works
- [x] All images load with fallback
- [x] Hover effects work on interactive elements
- [x] CTA buttons link correctly

## Notes

- The Home page design is based on typical K-GEO website needs since the Figma link couldn't be fully accessed
- All styling matches the existing About page design system
- Navigation and Footer are extracted as shared components for consistency
- The router uses `BrowserRouter` for clean URLs (no hash routing)

## Support

If you need to customize the Home page based on your specific Figma design:
1. Share screenshots or export the design
2. Provide specific content/copy
3. Indicate any special interactions or animations needed
